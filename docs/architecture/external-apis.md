# External APIs

  * **Discord Gateway API**: The primary real-time API used to receive events (like messages) from and send commands (like posting replies or changing status) to Discord.
  * **Google Gemini CLI**: The command-line tool used as the initial implementation for the AI service. The application will treat this as an external dependency, executing it as a sub-process.
