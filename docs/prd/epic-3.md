# Epic 3: Production Deployment & CI/CD Pipeline

**Goal**: Establish automated deployment pipeline and production-ready Kubernetes manifests for reliable, scalable bot deployment with comprehensive monitoring and security.

## Overview

Epic 3 focuses on transforming the BMAD Discord bot from a development-ready application into a production-deployable service with enterprise-grade CI/CD automation, Kubernetes orchestration, and operational excellence.

## Business Value

- **Operational Reliability**: Automated deployments reduce human error and deployment friction
- **Scalability**: Kubernetes enables horizontal scaling and resource optimization
- **Security**: Production-grade security contexts and secret management
- **Monitoring**: Comprehensive health checks and observability for production operations
- **Developer Productivity**: Automated CI/CD pipeline accelerates feature delivery

## Epic Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- Automated GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline for build, test, and deployment
- Production-ready Kubernetes manifests with proper resource management
- Secure configuration management using Kubernetes secrets and ConfigMaps
- Health checks and readiness probes for reliable pod lifecycle management
- Persistent storage configuration for SQLite database
- Container registry integration for artifact management

### Non-Functional Requirements
- **Security**: Follow Kubernetes security best practices, run as non-root user
- **Performance**: Resource limits aligned with current Docker Compose specifications
- **Reliability**: Health checks with appropriate timeouts and retry logic
- **Maintainability**: Clear documentation and deployment scripts
- **Scalability**: Kubernetes-native resource management and auto-scaling support

## Story 3.1: Implement GitHub Workflows and Kubernetes Deployment Manifests

**As a** system administrator  
**I want** automated GitHub workflows for CI/CD and Kubernetes deployment manifests for the BMAD Discord bot  
**so that** I can deploy and manage the bot reliably in a Kubernetes cluster with automated builds, testing, and deployments

### Acceptance Criteria

* 3.1.1: The system includes a GitHub Actions workflow for Continuous Integration that builds the Go application, runs tests, and validates code quality
* 3.1.2: The system includes a GitHub Actions workflow for Continuous Deployment that builds and pushes Docker images to a container registry upon successful CI
* 3.1.3: Kubernetes deployment manifest properly configures the bot with required resources, environment variables, and persistent storage
* 3.1.4: Kubernetes service account, secrets, and ConfigMap manifests manage authentication and configuration securely
* 3.1.5: Database persistence is handled through Kubernetes PersistentVolumeClaim for SQLite data directory
* 3.1.6: Health checks and readiness probes are configured for proper pod lifecycle management
* 3.1.7: Resource limits and requests are set according to existing Docker Compose specifications (512M memory, 0.5 CPU)
* 3.1.8: The deployment includes proper security contexts and follows Kubernetes security best practices

### Dependencies
- Completed Epic 1 (Core Conversational Bot)
- Completed Epic 2 (BMAD Knowledge Bot Specialization)
- Existing Dockerfile and docker-compose.yml configurations
- Access to GitHub Container Registry or equivalent

### Definition of Done
- All acceptance criteria are met and tested
- CI/CD pipeline successfully builds and deploys the application
- Kubernetes manifests deploy without errors in test environment
- Health checks validate application readiness
- Documentation is complete and deployment process is validated

## Future Stories (Planned)

### Story 3.2: Production Monitoring and Observability (Future)
Implement comprehensive monitoring, logging, and alerting for production deployment including metrics collection, log aggregation, and performance monitoring.

### Story 3.3: Security Hardening and Compliance (Future)  
Enhance security posture with network policies, RBAC refinement, vulnerability scanning, and compliance validation for production environments.

### Story 3.4: High Availability and Disaster Recovery (Future)
Implement multi-region deployment capabilities, backup strategies, and disaster recovery procedures for production resilience.

## Technical Constraints

- Must maintain backward compatibility with existing Docker Compose deployment
- SQLite database requires persistent storage with proper file permissions
- Multi-architecture support for different Kubernetes node types
- Resource constraints must align with current specifications to avoid performance regression
- Security contexts must enforce non-root execution and minimal privileges

## Success Metrics

- **Deployment Speed**: Automated deployment completes within 10 minutes
- **Reliability**: 99.9% successful deployment rate
- **Security**: Zero critical security vulnerabilities in deployed containers
- **Performance**: Resource usage within specified limits (512M memory, 0.5 CPU)
- **Observability**: Complete health check coverage with <30 second response times
