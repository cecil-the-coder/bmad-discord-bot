# Story 2.8: Support Bot Inclusion via Reply Mentions

## Status: Done

## Story

**As a** Discord user  
**I want** to include the BMAD knowledge bot in a conversation by replying to a user's question with just the bot mention  
**so that** the bot can provide BMAD-related answers in the context of the existing conversation thread without requiring the original user to directly mention the bot

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

* 2.8.1: The bot detects when it is mentioned in a reply to another user's message and processes the original message content as the query
* 2.8.2: The bot creates appropriate threading behavior, either responding in the existing thread or creating a new thread based on the conversation context
* 2.8.3: The bot maintains all existing BMAD knowledge base constraints and response formatting when processing reply-mentioned queries
* 2.8.4: The system preserves existing mention detection logic and thread management for direct mentions and auto-response scenarios
* 2.8.5: The reply mention feature works in both main channels and existing threads
* 2.8.6: The bot provides clear attribution when responding to reply mentions, indicating which message it is addressing

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From Story 2.7: The bot now supports multiple AI providers (Gemini and Ollama) with comprehensive configuration options. Reply mention functionality must work seamlessly with both AI providers and maintain all existing rate limiting and quota management features.

### Architecture Integration

**Discord Integration**: [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md, architecture/external-apis.md]
- **Discord Library**: discordgo v0.28.x for Discord Gateway API interaction
- **API Integration**: Discord Gateway API for real-time message events and message fetching
- **Message Reference Structure**: Discord's MessageReference field contains reply metadata including channel_id, message_id, guild_id

**Current Mention Handling**: [Source: internal/bot/handler.go analysis]
- **Entry Point**: `HandleMessageCreate` function processes all Discord messages (Lines 41-128)
- **Mention Detection**: Bot mention check using `m.Mentions` array iteration (Lines 80-86)
- **Query Extraction**: `extractQueryFromMention` function removes bot mention patterns (Lines 152-166)
- **Decision Logic**: `shouldProcess = botMentioned || shouldAutoRespond` (Lines 96-127)

### Component Architecture

**Core Components**: [Source: architecture/components.md]
- **Interaction Handler**: Parses message content, identifies mentions, routes requests to AI service
- **ThreadManager**: Creates new threads or finds existing ones for reply posting
- **AIService Interface**: Processes queries with BMAD knowledge base integration
- **RateLimitMonitor**: Manages API usage and service availability

**Message Processing Flow**: [Source: internal/bot/handler.go]
1. Message received via `HandleMessageCreate`
2. Bot self-message filtering (Lines 43-45)
3. Mention detection and logging (Lines 57-86)
4. Thread context determination (Lines 131-149)
5. Processing decision logic (Lines 96-127)
6. AI query processing and response generation

### Data Models

**Message Reference Structure**: [Source: Discord API documentation]
```go
type MessageReference struct {
    MessageID *string // ID of the message being replied to
    ChannelID *string // Channel ID where the referenced message exists
    GuildID   *string // Guild ID (for guild channels)
}
```

**Existing Data Models**: [Source: architecture/data-models.md]
- **MessageState**: Tracks last processed message per channel/thread for bot restart recovery
- **RateLimitState**: Manages API call tracking with thread-safe counters

### File Structure and Locations

**Source Tree**: [Source: architecture/source-tree.md]
- **Main Handler**: `internal/bot/handler.go` - Core message processing and mention detection
- **Bot Session**: `internal/bot/session.go` - Discord session management
- **AI Services**: `internal/service/` - AIService interface and implementations (gemini_cli.go, ollama_ai.go)
- **Storage Layer**: `internal/storage/` - Database operations and persistence
- **Testing**: `internal/bot/handler_test.go` - Comprehensive test coverage for message processing

### Technical Implementation Requirements
