# Story 1.6: Dynamic Bot Status for API Health

## Status: Complete

## Story

- As a user
- I want to see the bot's Discord status change color
- so that I have a quick visual indicator of its current API capacity and health

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

* 1.6.1: The bot's presence/status on Discord is updated based on the internal API usage monitor from Story 1.5.
* 1.6.2: When API usage is low, the status is set to "Online" (Green).
* 1.6.3: When API usage is approaching the rate limit (e.g., >75% capacity), the status is set to "Idle" (Yellow).
* 1.6.4: If the rate limit has been exceeded, the status is set to "Do Not Disturb" (Red).
* 1.6.5: The status returns to normal once the usage level drops.

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Dependencies

From Story 1.5 implementation:
- [`RateLimitManager`](internal/monitor/ratelimiter.go:1) provides provider-specific usage states (Normal, Warning, Throttled)
- [`AIService`](internal/service/ai_interface.go:1) interface with provider identification is established
- [`GeminiCLIService`](internal/service/gemini_cli.go:1) is registered as "gemini" provider with rate limit integration
- Thread-safe rate limit monitoring is implemented with `sync.RWMutex`
- Environment configuration patterns are established in [`main.go`](cmd/bot/main.go:1)

### Architecture Context

**Tech Stack Requirements**: [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- Language: Golang 1.24.x for backend service development
- Discord: discordgo v0.27.x for Discord API integration and presence management
- Testing: Go Test 1.24.x for unit & integration testing
- Logging: slog 1.24.x for structured logging

**Project Structure**: [Source: architecture/source-tree.md]
- Status manager service: [`internal/bot/status.go`](internal/bot/status.go:1) (create new)
- Bot session: [`internal/bot/session.go`](internal/bot/session.go:1) (extend existing)
- Rate limiter service: [`internal/monitor/ratelimiter.go`](internal/monitor/ratelimiter.go:1) (extend existing)
- Main entry point: [`cmd/bot/main.go`](cmd/bot/main.go:1) (extend existing)

**Coding Standards**: [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]
- **CRITICAL**: All Discord API interactions **MUST** go through the `BotSession` interface
- No direct calls to discordgo outside of session implementations
- All code must be formatted with `gofmt`
- Secrets must only be read from environment variables at startup

**Data Models**: [Source: architecture/data-models.md + Discord Status Integration]
- **StatusManager interface specification**:
  ```go
  type StatusManager interface {
      UpdateStatusFromRateLimit(providerID string, status string) error
      SetOnline(activity string) error
      SetIdle(activity string) error
      SetDoNotDisturb(activity string) error
      GetCurrentStatus() (discordgo.Status, *discordgo.Activity)
  }
  ```
- **Status mapping specification**:
  - Normal → discordgo.StatusOnline (Green)
  - Warning → discordgo.StatusIdle (Yellow) 
  - Throttled → discordgo.StatusDoNotDisturb (Red)
- Thread-safety required using proper synchronization for concurrent status updates

### Discord Status Implementation Details

**Status Update Logic**:
- Monitor rate limit state changes from Story 1.5 implementation
- Map provider-specific usage levels to Discord presence states
- Include informative activity messages showing current API health
- Implement debouncing to prevent rapid status flickering

**Status Levels and Messages**:
- **Online (Green)**: "API: Ready" - Normal usage, bot fully operational
- **Idle (Yellow)**: "API: Busy" - Warning level, approaching rate limits
- **Do Not Disturb (Red)**: "API: Throttled" - Rate limit exceeded, limited functionality

**Configuration Requirements**:
- Environment variables for enabling/disabling status updates
- Configurable update intervals to balance responsiveness with Discord API usage
- Graceful fallback if Discord status updates fail

### Testing

Dev Note: Story Requires the following tests:

- [ ] Go Test Unit Tests: (nextToFile: true), coverage requirement: 80%
- [ ] Go Test Integration Test (Test Location): location: next to bot implementations for Discord status integration validation

Manual Test Steps:
- Set BOT_TOKEN, GEMINI_CLI_PATH, BOT_STATUS_UPDATE_ENABLED=true, BOT_STATUS_UPDATE_INTERVAL=30s
- Set AI_PROVIDER_GEMINI_RATE_LIMIT_PER_MINUTE=10 (low limit for testing)
- Run `go run cmd/bot/main.go`
- Verify bot appears Online (Green) in Discord with "API: Ready" activity
- Send 8+ rapid @mentions within 1 minute to trigger Warning state (75% of 10/min limit)
- Verify bot status changes to Idle (Yellow) with "API: Busy" activity
- Send 10+ rapid @mentions within 1 minute to trigger Throttled state (100% of 10/min limit)
- Verify bot status changes to Do Not Disturb (Red) with "API: Throttled" activity
- Wait for rate limit window to reset and verify status returns to Online (Green)
- Test status update logging shows provider-specific status changes ("provider=gemini" in logs)
- Verify bot continues to function normally during status changes
- Test concurrent status updates with multiple simultaneous rate limit changes
- Test graceful handling of Discord API errors during status updates
