# Story 2.13: Add Discord Direct Message Support for BMAD Knowledge Bot

## Status: Done

## Story

**As a** Discord user who is a member of a server where the BMAD knowledge bot is active  
**I want** to send direct messages to the bot and receive BMAD-related answers privately  
**so that** I can ask questions about the BMAD-METHOD framework without interrupting server conversations or sharing my questions publicly

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

* 2.13.1: The bot detects and responds to direct messages (DMs) from users who are members of servers where the bot is active
* 2.13.2: DM conversations with the bot maintain the same BMAD knowledge base constraints and response quality as server interactions
* 2.13.3: DM messages are processed without requiring explicit bot mentions since the context is already private
* 2.13.4: The bot maintains conversation context within DM sessions, enabling multi-turn conversations about BMAD topics
* 2.13.5: DM message state is persisted in the database using the same message_states table structure with appropriate channel_id tracking
* 2.13.6: The bot gracefully handles DMs from users who are not members of any servers where the bot is active, providing an informative response
* 2.13.7: DM processing integrates with existing rate limiting, error handling, and AI service infrastructure
* 2.13.8: DM functionality respects user privacy and does not log sensitive information beyond standard operational logging

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From Story 2.12: The application is moving towards cloud-native stateless deployment with MySQL as the primary database, eliminating local filesystem dependencies. This affects how DM message states will be persisted. [Source: docs/stories/2.12.story.md]

From Story 2.11: Gemini AI support was removed, and the bot now operates exclusively with Ollama through the AIService interface. DM processing will use the same AIService implementation. [Source: docs/stories/2.11.story.md]

From Story 2.8: Reply mention functionality was implemented with sophisticated message fetching and context handling. Similar patterns can be applied to DM conversation context. [Source: docs/stories/2.8.story.md]

### Current Bot Architecture Analysis

**Message Processing Infrastructure**: [Source: internal/bot/handler.go]
- HandleMessageCreate already processes all message types including DMs
- Current logic focuses on guild-based processing (mentions, threads, auto-responses)
- Bot mentions are detected using `m.Mentions` and `s.State.User.ID` comparison
- Thread detection uses `h.isMessageInThread(s, m.ChannelID)` function
- Message state recording uses `h.recordMessageState(m, isInThread)` for persistence

**Discord Integration Readiness**: [Source: cmd/bot/main.go]
- Discord Gateway already includes `discordgo.IntentsDirectMessages` intent
- Bot has permission to receive and process DM messages
- Session configuration supports DM message events

**Message State Persistence Structure**: [Source: docs/architecture/database-schema.md, docs/architecture/data-models.md]
- `message_states` table uses (channel_id, thread_id) combination as unique key
- For DMs: channel_id = DM channel ID, thread_id = NULL
- Existing schema supports DM channel tracking without modifications
- Database operations handle nullable thread_id appropriately

**AIService Integration Points**: [Source: internal/service/ai_interface.go, docs/architecture/coding-standards.md]
- All AI processing MUST go through AIService interface (critical coding standard)
- Current implementation: OllamaAIService with devstral model
- Methods available: QueryAI, QueryAIWithSummary, SummarizeQuery, QueryWithContext
- BMAD knowledge base constraints applied through AIService implementation

### DM-Specific Implementation Requirements

**Channel Type Detection**: [Source: discordgo library documentation]
```go
// DM detection in HandleMessageCreate
if channel, err := s.Channel(m.ChannelID); err == nil {
    if channel.Type == discordgo.ChannelTypeDM {
        // Process as DM
    }
}
```

**Guild Membership Verification Strategy**:
- Use `s.State.Guilds` to enumerate bot's active guilds
- For each guild, check `s.GuildMember(guildID, m.Author.ID)` for user membership
- Implement caching to reduce API calls for repeated DM senders
- Handle rate limiting and API errors gracefully

**Message State Tracking for DMs**:
- DM channel_id represents the private channel between bot and user
- No thread_id needed (always NULL for DMs)
- Existing message recovery logic in `RecoverMissedMessages` should work for DMs
- DM channel IDs are stable and can be used for persistent state tracking

**Conversation Context in DMs**: [Source: internal/bot/handler.go]
- Adapt existing `fetchThreadHistory` logic for DM conversation history
- Use `s.ChannelMessages(channelID, limit, "", "", "")` for DM history
- Apply same conversation formatting as thread conversations
- Maintain chronological message ordering for context

**Response Handling Differences**:
- No thread creation needed for DMs (respond directly to DM channel)
- No thread title generation required
- No attribution or reply mention handling needed
- Direct response using `s.ChannelMessageSend(m.ChannelID, response)`

### Integration with Existing Infrastructure

**Rate Limiting Integration**: [Source: internal/monitor/ratelimiter.go]
- DM processing should use same rate limiting as server messages
- User-based rate limiting applies equally to DM and server interactions
- No special rate limiting rules needed for DMs

**Error Handling Patterns**: [Source: internal/bot/handler.go:400-500]
- Adapt existing error handling patterns for DM-specific errors
- Handle Discord API errors: user blocked bot, DM disabled, user left all mutual guilds
- Log DM processing errors with appropriate context
- Graceful degradation when DM sending fails

**Logging and Privacy Considerations**:
- Apply same logging patterns as server messages
- Avoid logging sensitive user information
- Use user IDs instead of usernames in logs where possible
- Follow existing privacy standards for message content logging

### Database Schema Compatibility

**Current Schema Adequacy**: [Source: docs/architecture/database-schema.md]
```sql
-- Existing schema supports DMs without modification
CREATE TABLE message_states (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    channel_id TEXT NOT NULL,        -- DM channel ID for DMs
    thread_id TEXT NULL,             -- Always NULL for DMs
    last_message_id TEXT NOT NULL,
    last_seen_timestamp INTEGER NOT NULL,
    created_at INTEGER NOT NULL,
    updated_at INTEGER NOT NULL,
    UNIQUE(channel_id, thread_id)    -- Works for DMs with NULL thread_id
);
```

**Data Model Compatibility**: [Source: docs/architecture/data-models.md]
```go
type MessageState struct {
    ID               int64     `db:"id"`
    ChannelID        string    `db:"channel_id"`        // DM channel ID
    ThreadID         *string   `db:"thread_id"`         // NULL for DMs
    LastMessageID    string    `db:"last_message_id"`
    LastSeenTimestamp int64    `db:"last_seen_timestamp"`
    CreatedAt        int64     `db:"created_at"`
    UpdatedAt        int64     `db:"updated_at"`
}
```

### File Structure and Implementation Locations

**Files to Modify**: [Source: docs/architecture/source-tree.md]
