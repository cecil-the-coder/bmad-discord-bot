# Story 2.5: Implement SQLite State Persistence for Message Tracking

## Status: Done

## Story

- As a system administrator
- I want the bot to persist the last seen message information in an SQLite database
- so that if the bot is disconnected or restarted, it can identify and respond to messages that were sent while it was offline within a configurable time window (default: 5 minutes)

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

* 2.5.1: An SQLite database is created and initialized with a table to store last seen message metadata per Discord channel/thread
* 2.5.2: The bot records the timestamp and message ID of the last processed message for each channel/thread before processing responses
* 2.5.3: On startup, the bot queries the database to retrieve the last seen message information for all channels/threads it has access to
* 2.5.4: The bot identifies messages sent after the last seen timestamp but only within a configurable time window (default: 5 minutes) and processes them in chronological order
* 2.5.9: Messages older than the configured recovery window are ignored to prevent processing stale conversations
* 2.5.5: The database schema includes channel ID, thread ID (nullable), last message ID, last seen timestamp, and creation/update timestamps
* 2.5.6: Database operations are properly handled with connection pooling, error handling, and graceful degradation if database is unavailable
* 2.5.7: The state persistence integrates with existing bot functionality without breaking current conversation flows
* 2.5.8: Database file location and message recovery time window are configurable via environment variables with sensible defaults

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From Story 2.4: The bot now uses integrated summarization to reduce API calls. The state persistence should work alongside this optimization and not interfere with the existing QueryAIWithSummary() workflow.

### Technical Implementation Details
- **New Package Location**: Create `internal/storage/` following source tree structure [Source: architecture/source-tree.md]
- **Database Choice**: SQLite for local file-based persistence, suitable for single-instance bot deployment
- **Integration Pattern**: Follow existing interface pattern like AIService to allow future storage backend changes [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]
- **File Location**: Default database path should be `./data/bot_state.db` with directory auto-creation
- **Recovery Window**: Default 5-minute window prevents processing stale conversations and reduces Discord API load

### Data Models
**MessageState Table Schema:**
```sql
CREATE TABLE message_states (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    channel_id TEXT NOT NULL,
    thread_id TEXT NULL,
    last_message_id TEXT NOT NULL,
    last_seen_timestamp INTEGER NOT NULL,
    created_at INTEGER NOT NULL,
    updated_at INTEGER NOT NULL,
    UNIQUE(channel_id, thread_id)
);
```

**Go Struct:**
```go
type MessageState struct {
    ID               int64     `db:"id"`
    ChannelID        string    `db:"channel_id"`
    ThreadID         *string   `db:"thread_id"`
    LastMessageID    string    `db:"last_message_id"`
    LastSeenTimestamp int64    `db:"last_seen_timestamp"`
    CreatedAt        int64     `db:"created_at"`
    UpdatedAt        int64     `db:"updated_at"`
}
```

### Architecture Additions Required
- **Tech Stack**: Add `github.com/mattn/go-sqlite3` driver and appropriate Go SQL libraries
- **Database Schema**: Update from "Not applicable" to include message state persistence design
- **Error Handling**: Database operations must gracefully degrade - bot should continue functioning if database is temporarily unavailable

### Performance Considerations
- Database writes should be asynchronous where possible to avoid blocking message processing
- Implement connection pooling for concurrent access
- Add indexes on channel_id and thread_id for efficient lookups
- Time window constraint (default: 5 minutes) prevents excessive Discord API calls during startup
- Recovery window should be configurable via MESSAGE_RECOVERY_WINDOW_MINUTES environment variable

### Testing

Dev Note: Story Requires the following tests:

- [x] Go Test Unit Tests: (nextToFile: true), coverage requirement: 80%
- [x] Go Test Integration Test (Test Location): location: `internal/storage/sqlite_test.go`
- [ ] Manual E2E Test: location: Manual verification of persistence across bot restarts

Manual Test Steps:
- Start bot and send test messages in various channels/threads
- Stop bot while messages are being sent
- Restart bot within 5 minutes and verify it processes missed messages in correct order
- Restart bot after 5+ minutes and verify it skips old messages
- Verify database contains accurate last seen message information
- Test configurable recovery window with different MESSAGE_RECOVERY_WINDOW_MINUTES values
- Test graceful degradation when database file is locked or unavailable
