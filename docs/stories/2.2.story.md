# Story 2.2: Intelligent Daily API Rate Limit Handling

**As a** system administrator or bot user  
**I want** the system to intelligently detect and handle daily API quota exhaustion for all Gemini operations  
**So that** the bot gracefully manages quota limits, avoids wasteful retry attempts, and provides clear feedback about service availability.

## Description:
Currently, when the Gemini API's daily quota is exceeded, the system logs `429 Too Many Requests` errors and attempts retries with backoff logic. However, since daily quotas reset at specific intervals (typically UTC midnight), continued retry attempts within the same quota period will always fail, leading to:

- Wasted computational resources on futile retry attempts
- Poor user experience with unclear error messages
- Potential additional rate limiting penalties
- No visibility into when service will be restored

This story implements intelligent quota exhaustion detection and management across all Gemini operations.

## Acceptance Criteria:

### AC 2.2.1: Daily Quota Detection
* **GIVEN** the system makes any Gemini API call (CLI or direct API)
* **WHEN** the response indicates daily quota exhaustion (429 with daily quota message)
* **THEN** the system should parse and identify this as a daily quota issue (not temporary rate limiting)
* **AND** the system should log a distinct error message: "Daily quota exhausted for Gemini API"
* **AND** the system should extract quota reset time if available in the response

### AC 2.2.2: Quota State Management
* **GIVEN** daily quota exhaustion is detected
* **WHEN** the quota exhaustion occurs
* **THEN** the system should set a daily quota exhausted flag for the Gemini provider
* **AND** the system should calculate and store the expected quota reset time (next UTC midnight)
* **AND** the system should prevent further Gemini API calls until reset time
* **AND** the system should automatically clear the exhausted flag after the reset time

### AC 2.2.3: User-Facing Error Handling
* **GIVEN** a user attempts to interact with the bot
* **WHEN** the daily quota is exhausted
* **THEN** the system should respond with a clear, user-friendly message:
  - "I've reached my daily quota for AI processing. Service will be restored tomorrow at midnight UTC."
* **AND** the system should not attempt to process the request through Gemini
* **AND** the system should log the blocked request for monitoring purposes

### AC 2.2.4: Administrative Notifications
* **GIVEN** daily quota exhaustion occurs
* **WHEN** the quota is first detected as exhausted
* **THEN** the system should log a high-priority alert for system administrators
* **AND** the log should include: timestamp, provider ID, expected reset time, and current usage stats
* **AND** the system should provide a clear indication of service impact

### AC 2.2.5: Graceful Service Restoration
* **GIVEN** the quota reset time has passed
* **WHEN** the next user interaction occurs
* **THEN** the system should automatically detect that quota has reset
* **AND** the system should clear the exhausted flag and resume normal operations
* **AND** the system should log the service restoration event

### AC 2.2.6: Integration with Rate Limiting
* **GIVEN** the existing rate limiting system (from Story 1.2)
* **WHEN** daily quota exhaustion is detected
* **THEN** the quota exhaustion should integrate with the existing rate limiter
* **AND** the provider status should be set to "Quota Exhausted" (distinct from "Throttled")
* **AND** the rate limiter should respect the quota exhaustion state

## Priority: High
## Effort Estimate: Medium (requires error parsing, state management, integration with existing rate limiting)
## Dependencies: 
- Existing Gemini CLI integration (Story 2.1)
- Rate limiting system (Story 1.2)
- Future API fallback integration (Story 2.3)

## Technical Implementation Notes:
- Daily quota error message pattern: `Quota exceeded for quota metric 'Gemini.*Requests' and limit '.*per day.*'`
- Reset time calculation: Next UTC midnight (00:00:00 UTC)
- State storage: In-memory flag with timestamp (no persistence required across restarts)
- Rate limiter integration: Extend existing provider status with "Quota Exhausted" state
- Error detection works for both CLI and future direct API implementations

## Success Metrics:
- Zero retry attempts after daily quota detection
- Clear user feedback when quota is exhausted
- Automatic service restoration after quota reset
- Reduced resource waste from futile retry attempts
- Improved system observability through distinct quota exhaustion logs

## Definition of Done:
- [x] Daily quota error detection implemented for all Gemini operations
- [x] Quota state management prevents unnecessary API calls
- [x] User-facing error messages are clear and helpful
- [x] Administrative logging provides adequate monitoring visibility
- [x] Automatic service restoration works after quota reset
- [x] Integration with existing rate limiting system is seamless
- [x] Unit tests cover quota detection, state management, and restoration
- [x] Integration tests verify end-to-end quota handling behavior
