# Story 2.9: Migrate from SQLite to MySQL for Cloud-Native Deployment

## Status: Done

## Story

**As a** system administrator  
**I want** to migrate the bot's data persistence from SQLite to MySQL  
**so that** the application is decoupled from the local filesystem and suitable for Kubernetes/cloud-native deployment with external database services

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

* 2.9.1: The system supports MySQL database connection with configurable host, port, database name, username, and password via environment variables.
* 2.9.2: All existing SQLite schema and data models are migrated to MySQL with equivalent functionality and data integrity.
* 2.9.3: Database initialization automatically creates required tables and indexes if they don't exist, with proper error handling for connection failures.
* 2.9.4: All existing storage operations (message tracking, rate limiting state, thread context) work identically with MySQL backend.
* 2.9.5: The system includes database migration scripts or automated migration from existing SQLite data to MySQL.
* 2.9.6: Connection pooling and proper connection management are implemented for production reliability and performance.
* 2.9.7: The MySQL integration maintains backward compatibility with existing storage interface contracts.
* 2.9.8: Comprehensive error handling for database connectivity issues, including graceful degradation when database is unavailable.

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From Story 2.8: The bot uses persistent storage for message state tracking and thread ownership management. The current SQLite implementation provides reliable persistence but is filesystem-dependent, making it unsuitable for cloud-native deployments where pods may be ephemeral and require external data persistence.

### Current SQLite Implementation Analysis

**Database Configuration**: [Source: cmd/bot/main.go, internal/storage/sqlite.go]
- Default database path: `./data/bot_state.db` [Source: cmd/bot/main.go]
- Configurable via `DATABASE_PATH` environment variable [Source: cmd/bot/main.go]
- SQLite connection string: `?_journal_mode=WAL&_synchronous=NORMAL&_cache_size=1000&_foreign_keys=1` [Source: internal/storage/sqlite.go]
- Directory auto-created if it doesn't exist [Source: internal/storage/sqlite.go]

**Current Data Models**: [Source: internal/storage/interface.go]
- `MessageState` struct: Tracks last processed message per Discord channel/thread
- `ThreadOwnership` struct: Tracks bot-created thread ownership for auto-response
- Both use `db` struct tags for database mapping

**Storage Interface Pattern**: [Source: internal/storage/interface.go]
- Well-defined `StorageService` interface with 11 methods:
  - Initialize, Close, GetMessageState, UpsertMessageState, GetAllMessageStates
  - GetMessageStatesWithinWindow, HealthCheck, GetThreadOwnership, UpsertThreadOwnership
  - GetAllThreadOwnerships, CleanupOldThreadOwnerships
- All methods use `context.Context` for cancellation and timeouts
- Interface ensures complete decoupling between storage implementation and business logic

### Current Database Schema

**SQLite Schema**: [Source: docs/architecture/database-schema.md]
```sql
CREATE TABLE message_states (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    channel_id TEXT NOT NULL,
    thread_id TEXT NULL,
    last_message_id TEXT NOT NULL,
    last_seen_timestamp INTEGER NOT NULL,
    created_at INTEGER NOT NULL,
    updated_at INTEGER NOT NULL,
    UNIQUE(channel_id, thread_id)
);

CREATE TABLE thread_ownerships (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    thread_id TEXT NOT NULL UNIQUE,
    original_user_id TEXT NOT NULL,
    created_by TEXT NOT NULL,
    creation_time INTEGER NOT NULL,
    created_at INTEGER NOT NULL,
    updated_at INTEGER NOT NULL
);
```

**Required MySQL Schema Conversion**:
- INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT → BIGINT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT
- TEXT → VARCHAR(255) for limited text fields, TEXT for large content
- Maintain all existing indexes and constraints
- Preserve UNIQUE constraints and foreign key relationships

### Connection Management Requirements

**Current SQLite Configuration**: [Source: internal/storage/sqlite.go]
- Connection pool: MaxOpenConns=10, MaxIdleConns=5, ConnMaxLifetime=1 hour
- Prepared statements cached in map for performance
- 11 prepared statement templates defined for database operations across the StorageService interface methods

**MySQL Connection Requirements**:
- Similar connection pool configuration adapted for MySQL
- MySQL-specific connection parameters (charset=utf8mb4, parseTime=true)
- Connection retry logic for network failures
- Health check implementation using MySQL PING

### File Structure and Implementation Locations

**Current Structure**: [Source: docs/architecture/source-tree.md]
```
internal/
├── storage/            # Database operations and persistence layer
│   ├── interface.go    # StorageService interface definition (DO NOT MODIFY)
│   ├── sqlite.go       # SQLite implementation (KEEP for backward compatibility)
│   └── mysql.go        # NEW: MySQL implementation
```

**Required New Files**:
- `internal/storage/mysql.go` - MySQL StorageService implementation
- `internal/storage/mysql_test.go` - MySQL-specific tests
- `cmd/migrate/main.go` - Data migration utility (optional)

### Technology Stack Integration

**Current Database Stack**: [Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md]
- Database: SQLite3 v3.x for message state persistence
- Database Driver: go-sqlite3 v1.14.x (CGO-based SQLite driver)

**Required MySQL Stack**:
- Database: MySQL 8.0+ or MariaDB 10.x
- Database Driver: go-sql-driver/mysql (pure Go MySQL driver)
- Connection pooling: database/sql standard library
- Migration tools: golang-migrate or custom implementation

### Environment Variables Configuration

**Required MySQL Environment Variables**:
- `MYSQL_HOST` - MySQL server hostname (default: localhost)
- `MYSQL_PORT` - MySQL server port (default: 3306)
- `MYSQL_DATABASE` - Database name (default: bmad_bot)
- `MYSQL_USERNAME` - Database username
- `MYSQL_PASSWORD` - Database password
- `MYSQL_TIMEOUT` - Connection timeout (default: 30s)
- `DATABASE_TYPE` - Storage type selection (sqlite|mysql, default: sqlite)

### Data Migration Strategy

**Migration Requirements**:
- Export all existing SQLite data preserving relationships
- Transform data types as needed (INTEGER timestamps remain compatible)
- Maintain data integrity during migration process
- Provide rollback capability in case of migration failure
- Support incremental migration for large datasets

**Migration Implementation Options**:
1. **Online Migration**: Read from SQLite, write to MySQL in real-time
2. **Offline Migration**: Export/import utility for deployment-time migration
3. **Dual-Write**: Temporary period writing to both databases for safety
