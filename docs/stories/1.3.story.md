# Story 1.3: Threaded Conversation Creation

## Status: Approved

## Story

- As a user
- I want the bot to create a new thread when it answers my question
- so that our conversation is neatly organized and doesn't clutter the main channel

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

* 1.3.1: When the bot replies to a user's initial @-mention (that is not already in a thread), it must create a new public Discord Thread.
* 1.3.2: The thread title should be a summarized version of the user's initial question.
* 1.3.3: The bot's answer (from Story 1.2 functionality) is posted as the first message within the newly created thread.

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Context
- Story 1.1 established Discord connection and basic bot infrastructure
- Story 1.2 implemented mention detection and direct reply functionality using [`s.ChannelMessageSendReply()`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/bwmarrin/discordgo#Session.ChannelMessageSendReply)
- [`AIService`](internal/service/ai_interface.go:1) interface and [`GeminiCLIService`](internal/service/gemini_cli.go:1) implementation are already established
- Environment variable handling and structured logging patterns are established

### Architecture Context

**Tech Stack Requirements**: [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- Language: Golang 1.24.x for backend service development
- Discord Library: discordgo v0.28.x for Discord Gateway API interaction
- Testing: Go Test 1.24.x for unit & integration testing
- Logging: slog 1.24.x for structured logging

**Project Structure**: [Source: architecture/source-tree.md]
- AI service interface: [`internal/service/ai_interface.go`](internal/service/ai_interface.go:1) (extend existing)
- Gemini CLI implementation: [`internal/service/gemini_cli.go`](internal/service/gemini_cli.go:1) (extend existing)
- Core bot logic: [`internal/bot/handler.go`](internal/bot/handler.go:1) (extend existing)
- Main entry point: [`cmd/bot/main.go`](cmd/bot/main.go:1) (extend existing)

**Coding Standards**: [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]
- **CRITICAL**: All business logic for AI interaction **MUST** use the `AIService` interface
- No direct calls to `gemini-cli` outside of `GeminiCLIService` implementation
- Thread management logic should be encapsulated in appropriate service layers
- All code must be formatted with `gofmt`
- Secrets must only be read from environment variables at startup

**External API Integration**: [Source: architecture/external-apis.md]
- **Discord Gateway API**: Used for thread creation, message posting, and permission validation
- **Google Gemini CLI**: Used for both answer generation and question summarization

**Data Models**: [Source: architecture/data-models.md]
- No persistent database required for MVP
- In-memory thread tracking may be needed for context management
- Consider thread metadata storage for future conversation context (Story 1.4)

### Discord API Considerations

**Thread Creation Requirements**:
- Bot needs `CREATE_PUBLIC_THREADS` permission in the channel
- Thread titles are limited to 100 characters maximum
- Public threads are automatically archived after 24 hours of inactivity (default)
- Thread creation rate limits apply (10 threads per 10 minutes per channel)

**Message Flow Changes**:
- Current: User mention → Bot reply in same channel
- New: User mention → Create thread → Bot reply in thread
- Preserve existing behavior for mentions already within threads

### Testing

Dev Note: Story Requires the following tests:

- [ ] Go Test Unit Tests: (nextToFile: true), coverage requirement: 80%
- [ ] Go Test Integration Test (Test Location): location: next to handler for Discord thread creation validation
- [ ] Manual verification through Discord server interaction

Manual Test Steps:
- Set BOT_TOKEN and GEMINI_CLI_PATH environment variables
- Run `go run cmd/bot/main.go`
- Send message in Discord server main channel: `@BotName What is the capital of France?`
- Verify bot creates new public thread with summarized title
- Verify bot's answer appears as first message in the created thread
- Test edge cases: very long/short questions, special characters in questions
- Verify existing thread behavior remains unchanged (mention bot in existing thread should reply directly)
