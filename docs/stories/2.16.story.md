# Story 2.16: Implement User Rate Limiting and Channel Restrictions for BMAD Knowledge Bot

## Status: Approved

## Story

**As a** system administrator managing the BMAD knowledge bot  
**I want** to set rate limits on requests from users (unless they have "admin" role set in config) and specify channel IDs the bot will read messages from  
**so that** I can prevent abuse and resource exhaustion while controlling where the bot operates, ensuring consistent service quality for all users

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

* 2.16.1: The system implements user-based rate limiting that tracks individual user request counts per configurable time window (default: 5 requests per minute per user)
* 2.16.2: Users with the "admin" role (configurable role name) bypass all rate limiting restrictions and can make unlimited requests
* 2.16.3: Rate limiting state persists across bot restarts using the existing database infrastructure to prevent reset exploitation
* 2.16.4: The system provides configurable channel restrictions that allow specifying which channel IDs the bot will monitor and respond to messages in
* 2.16.5: Channel restrictions apply to all message types (mentions, reactions, auto-responses, DMs) with DMs remaining unrestricted by default
* 2.16.6: Rate limited users receive informative messages explaining the limit and when they can make their next request
* 2.16.7: Channel restrictions are enforced even when the bot is mentioned or reacted to with configured emoji in non-allowed channels
* 2.16.8: All rate limiting and channel restriction settings are stored in the database configuration system for hot-reloading without restart
* 2.16.9: Rate limiting integrates with existing AI provider rate limiting without conflicts or double-limiting scenarios
* 2.16.10: Administrative commands or interfaces allow authorized users to view rate limiting status and temporarily modify limits for specific users

### Previous Story Insights

From Story 2.15: The application has comprehensive Discord message handling with typing indicators, DM processing, and improved formatting. Rate limiting should integrate seamlessly with existing message processing infrastructure. [Source: docs/stories/2.15.story.md]

From Story 2.14: Forum channel support was added with configurable channel monitoring. Channel restrictions should follow similar patterns for consistency. [Source: docs/stories/2.14.story.md]

From Story 2.13: DM processing infrastructure exists and should remain unrestricted by channel limitations to maintain private communication capabilities. [Source: docs/stories/2.13.story.md]

From Story 2.10: Database configuration system exists for hot-reloadable settings, providing the foundation for rate limiting and channel restriction configuration. [Source: docs/stories/2.10.story.md]

### Current Rate Limiting Architecture Analysis

**AI Provider Rate Limiting Infrastructure**: [Source: internal/monitor/ratelimiter.go]
- RateLimitManager with provider-specific rate limiting (Ollama)
- ProviderRateLimitState tracks API calls per time window
- Configurable limits: minute (60), day (1000) with warning/throttled thresholds
- Status callbacks for rate limit state changes
- Daily quota exhaustion handling with reset time tracking

**Current User Authorization Patterns**: [Source: internal/bot/handler.go:1733-1779]
- isUserAuthorizedForReactionTrigger() checks user IDs and role names
- Role checking via Discord API: s.GuildMember() and s.GuildRoles()
- Approved user IDs and role names stored in configuration
- Role ID to name mapping for flexible role-based authorization

**Message Processing Integration Points**: [Source: internal/bot/handler.go:95-300]
- HandleMessageCreate() as main entry point for all message processing
- DM detection via isDMChannel() and processDMMessage()
- Forum channel processing via isForumChannel() and processForumPost()
- Thread and main channel processing with existing rate limiting integration

### Database Configuration System Integration

**Configuration Service Architecture**: [Source: internal/config/interface.go, internal/config/loader.go]
- ConfigService interface with database-first loading and environment fallback
- Hot-reloading via ReloadConfigs() and automatic refresh intervals
- Typed configuration getters: GetConfigInt(), GetConfigBool(), GetConfigDuration()
- Configuration categories for organized management (rate_limiting, features, etc.)

**Configuration Storage Schema**: [Source: internal/storage/interface.go]
```go
type Configuration struct {
    Key         string `db:"key"`
    Value       string `db:"value"`
    ValueType   string `db:"value_type"`   // string, int, bool, duration
    Category    string `db:"category"`     // rate_limiting, channel_restrictions
    Description string `db:"description"`
    CreatedAt   int64  `db:"created_at"`
    UpdatedAt   int64  `db:"updated_at"`
}
```

**Configuration Migration Patterns**: [Source: internal/config/loader.go:147-261]
- Environment variable to database migration for existing settings
- Default configuration seeding for new installations
- Secure vs non-secure configuration key separation

### User Rate Limiting Implementation Requirements

**Database Schema for User Rate Limiting**: [Source: docs/architecture/database-schema.md patterns]
```sql
CREATE TABLE user_rate_limits (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    user_id TEXT NOT NULL,
    time_window TEXT NOT NULL,    -- 'minute', 'hour', 'day'
    request_count INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,
    window_start_time INTEGER NOT NULL,  -- Unix timestamp
    last_request_time INTEGER NOT NULL,  -- Unix timestamp
    created_at INTEGER NOT NULL,
    updated_at INTEGER NOT NULL,
    UNIQUE(user_id, time_window)
);
```

**Integration with Message Processing**: [Source: internal/bot/handler.go analysis]
- Rate limiting check before AI service calls in all processing paths
- Early return with informative message for rate-limited users
- Admin role bypass check using existing role authorization patterns
- Logging for rate limiting events and bypass usage

**Rate Limiting Service Design**: [Source: internal/monitor/ratelimiter.go patterns]
```go
type UserRateLimiter interface {
    CheckUserRateLimit(userID string, guildID string) (*RateLimitResult, error)
    RecordUserRequest(userID string) error
    IsUserAdmin(userID string, guildID string) (bool, error)
    GetUserRateLimitStatus(userID string) (*UserRateLimitStatus, error)
    ResetUserRateLimit(userID string) error
}

type RateLimitResult struct {
    Allowed bool
    Reason string
    NextAvailableTime time.Time
    RequestsRemaining int
}
```

### Channel Restriction Implementation Requirements

**Channel Configuration Data Model**: [Source: internal/config patterns]
```go
type ChannelRestrictions struct {
    AllowedChannelIDs []string `json:"allowed_channel_ids"`
    RestrictDMs bool `json:"restrict_dms"`
    AdminBypassEnabled bool `json:"admin_bypass_enabled"`
}
```

**Message Handler Integration**: [Source: internal/bot/handler.go:95-300]
- Channel restriction check in HandleMessageCreate() before any processing
- Channel ID validation against configured allowed channels list
- DM exemption logic (always allowed unless explicitly restricted)
- Admin bypass for channel restrictions if configured

**Configuration Keys for Database Storage**:
- `USER_RATE_LIMIT_PER_MINUTE` (int, default: 5)
- `USER_RATE_LIMIT_PER_HOUR` (int, default: 30)
- `USER_RATE_LIMIT_PER_DAY` (int, default: 100)
- `ADMIN_ROLE_NAMES` (string, comma-separated, default: "admin")
- `ALLOWED_CHANNEL_IDS` (string, comma-separated, default: "")
- `CHANNEL_RESTRICTIONS_ENABLED` (bool, default: false)
- `RATE_LIMITING_ENABLED` (bool, default: true)
