## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From Story 2.11: Gemini AI support was removed from the application. The bot now operates exclusively with Ollama as the AI provider while maintaining the extensible AIService interface for future provider integrations. [Source: docs/stories/2.11.story.md]

From Story 2.10: The bot now supports database-backed configuration management with hot-reload capabilities using MySQL as the cloud-native database solution. [Source: docs/stories/2.10.story.md]

### Architecture Integration
- **Build Requirements**: Go 1.24 with CGO enabled for SQLite support, also supports MySQL driver [Source: Dockerfile, .env.example]
- **Container Base**: Multi-stage build using golang:1.24-alpine and node:22-alpine [Source: Dockerfile]
- **Entry Point**: `/app/main` executable from `cmd/bot/main.go` [Source: Dockerfile]
- **Security**: Non-root user execution, security labels, no-new-privileges [Source: Dockerfile]

### Container and Runtime Requirements
**Docker Configuration**: [Source: Dockerfile]
- **Base Images**: golang:1.24-alpine (builder), node:22-alpine (runtime)
- **Build Dependencies**: git, gcc, musl-dev, sqlite-dev (for CGO compilation)
- **Runtime Dependencies**: CA certificates, SQLite runtime libraries
- **Build Command**: `CGO_ENABLED=1 GOOS=linux go build -a -installsuffix cgo -ldflags='-w -s' -o main cmd/bot/main.go`
- **Working Directory**: `/app`
- **User**: Non-root user `node` (UID: 1000)
- **Directories**: `/app/logs` and `/app/data` with proper permissions (775) - data directory required by current Dockerfile

### **CRITICAL DEPLOYMENT CONFIGURATION NOTE**
**Current Reality vs Epic Goal Alignment**: 
The current Dockerfile (CGO_ENABLED=1 + SQLite dependencies) supports BOTH SQLite and MySQL database modes via DATABASE_TYPE environment variable. For MySQL-only Kubernetes deployment:
1. **RECOMMENDED**: Use current Dockerfile as-is - provides database flexibility and fallback options
2. **ALTERNATIVE**: Create MySQL-optimized Dockerfile variant with CGO_ENABLED=0 and remove SQLite dependencies
3. **HYBRID**: Maintain both Dockerfile variants for different deployment scenarios

[Source: Analysis of Dockerfile vs Epic 3 MySQL-only requirements]

**Resource Constraints**: [Source: docker-compose.yml]
- Memory Limit: 512MB
- CPU Limit: 0.5 cores
- Memory Request: 256MB (suggested)
- CPU Request: 0.25 cores (suggested)

### Database and Storage Requirements
**Database Configuration**: [Source: .env.example, .env.mysql-example, Dockerfile]
- **Dual Database Support**: Application supports both SQLite (default) and MySQL via DATABASE_TYPE environment variable
- **MySQL Configuration** (DATABASE_TYPE=mysql):
  - External MySQL service connection
  - Configurable via MYSQL_* environment variables
  - Connection pooling and timeout configuration supported
  - MySQL driver works with current CGO_ENABLED=1 build
  - Schema migration handled automatically on startup
  - Database must be pre-created with proper user permissions
- **SQLite Fallback** (DATABASE_TYPE=sqlite):
  - Uses `/app/data` directory created by Dockerfile
  - Provides deployment flexibility and development support
  - Requires PersistentVolume in Kubernetes for data persistence
- **Storage Requirements**: PersistentVolume needed for `/app/data` directory (created by current Dockerfile regardless of database choice)

### Environment Variables Configuration
**Required Variables**: [Source: .env.mysql-example]
- `BOT_TOKEN`: Discord bot token (Secret)
- `DATABASE_TYPE`: mysql (fixed value)
- `MYSQL_HOST`: MySQL server hostname
- `MYSQL_PORT`: MySQL server port (default: 3306)
- `MYSQL_DATABASE`: MySQL database name
- `MYSQL_USERNAME`: MySQL username
- `MYSQL_PASSWORD`: MySQL password (Secret)
- `MYSQL_TIMEOUT`: MySQL connection timeout

**AI Provider Configuration**: [Source: .env.mysql-example, docs/stories/2.11.story.md]
```yaml
# AI Provider Configuration (Ollama only - as per Story 2.11)
AI_PROVIDER: ollama

# Ollama Configuration
OLLAMA_HOST: https://ollama
OLLAMA_MODEL: devstral
OLLAMA_TIMEOUT: 30

- Health check endpoint available (internal)
- No service-to-service communication required

**External Dependencies**:
- Discord Gateway API (outbound HTTPS)
- Ollama API (configurable endpoint, default: https://ollama)
- MySQL database service (required for cloud-native deployment)
- Optional: GitHub API for BMAD knowledge base refresh (outbound HTTPS)

### Security Requirements
**Container Security**: [Source: Dockerfile]
- Run as non-root user (node from node:22-alpine)
- Security context: `no-new-privileges: true`
- Read-only root filesystem where possible
- Minimal attack surface with alpine base images

**Kubernetes Security**:
- SecurityContext with runAsNonRoot: true, runAsUser: 1000
- Drop ALL capabilities
- ReadOnlyRootFilesystem: true (except for /app/logs volume)
- ServiceAccount with minimal required permissions (no additional RBAC needed)

### Health Check Implementation
**Health Check Implementation**: [Source: docker-compose.yml, Dockerfile]
- Application supports `--health-check` flag for validation
- Health check command: `/app/main --health-check`
- Implementation validates Discord connection and basic application health
- Use for Kubernetes liveness and readiness probes
- Startup probe needed for initial bot connection establishment

### CI/CD Pipeline Requirements
**GitHub Actions Configuration**:
- Go 1.24 build environment
- CGO_ENABLED=1 to match current Dockerfile build configuration
- Build dependencies: git, gcc, musl-dev, sqlite-dev (matching Dockerfile)
- Multi-architecture build support (linux/amd64, linux/arm64)
- Security scanning integration
- Container registry push to GitHub Container Registry (ghcr.io)

**Alternative MySQL-Only Build** (Future Enhancement):
- Option to create MySQL-optimized build with CGO_ENABLED=0
- Removes SQLite dependencies for smaller container image
- Requires separate Dockerfile variant for pure MySQL deployment

**Build Optimization**:
- Layer caching for faster builds
- Multi-stage Dockerfile optimization
- Dependency caching for Go modules
- Parallel job execution where possible
