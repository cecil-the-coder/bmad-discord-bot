# Story 2.3: Implement Gemini Model Fallback Support

**As a** system administrator or bot user  
**I want** the bot to automatically fallback to a lighter Gemini model when the primary model hits its rate limit  
**So that** the bot maintains functionality even when the primary model quota is exhausted, providing continuous service availability.

## Description:
Currently, the bot uses a single Gemini model (default: `gemini-2.5-pro`) for all AI operations through the Gemini CLI. When this model hits its daily quota or rate limit, the entire bot functionality becomes unavailable until the quota resets.

This story implements a model fallback mechanism using the Gemini CLI's `--model` parameter to automatically switch to a lighter model (`gemini-2.5-flash-lite`) when the primary model becomes unavailable due to rate limiting or quota exhaustion.

## Acceptance Criteria:

### AC 2.3.1: Model Configuration Support
* **GIVEN** the system is being configured
* **WHEN** the system starts up
* **THEN** the system should support a `GEMINI_PRIMARY_MODEL` environment variable (default: `gemini-2.5-pro`)
* **AND** the system should support a `GEMINI_FALLBACK_MODEL` environment variable (default: `gemini-2.5-flash-lite`)
* **AND** the system should log which models are configured as primary and fallback
* **AND** the system should validate that both models are supported by the CLI

### AC 2.3.2: Primary Model Rate Limit Detection
* **GIVEN** the system makes a Gemini CLI call using the primary model
* **WHEN** the CLI returns a rate limit or quota exhaustion error for the primary model
* **THEN** the system should detect this as a model-specific limitation
* **AND** the system should log the primary model rate limit event
* **AND** the system should mark the primary model as temporarily unavailable
* **AND** the system should record the timestamp of the rate limit event

### AC 2.3.3: Automatic Model Fallback
* **GIVEN** the primary model is rate limited or quota exhausted
* **WHEN** a new AI request is made
* **THEN** the system should automatically use the fallback model with the `--model` parameter
* **AND** the system should execute the same request using `gemini-cli --model gemini-2.5-flash-lite -p "prompt"`
* **AND** the system should log the fallback attempt and model switch
* **AND** the system should maintain all existing functionality (BMAD integration, rate limiting, timeouts)

### AC 2.3.4: Model State Management
* **GIVEN** the system is tracking model availability
* **WHEN** models become rate limited or quotas are exhausted
* **THEN** the system should maintain separate state for each model's availability
* **AND** the system should track rate limit reset times for each model independently
* **AND** the system should automatically restore primary model usage after reset time
* **AND** the system should provide status information for both models

### AC 2.3.5: Graceful Model Restoration
* **GIVEN** the primary model was rate limited
* **WHEN** sufficient time has passed for the rate limit to reset (typically UTC midnight for daily quotas)
* **THEN** the system should automatically attempt to use the primary model again
* **AND** the system should log the model restoration attempt
* **AND** the system should fall back to the fallback model if the primary is still unavailable
* **AND** the system should continue normal operation with whichever model is available

### AC 2.3.6: Enhanced Error Handling
* **GIVEN** the system is using model fallback
* **WHEN** both primary and fallback models are rate limited
* **THEN** the system should provide a clear user message: "All AI models are currently rate limited. Please try again later."
* **AND** the system should log a critical alert about complete service unavailability
* **AND** the system should provide estimated restoration times for both models
* **AND** the system should continue monitoring for model availability restoration

### AC 2.3.7: Integration with Existing Rate Limiting
* **GIVEN** the existing rate limiting system (Story 1.2) and quota handling (Story 2.2)
* **WHEN** model fallback is implemented
* **THEN** the rate limiting should work independently for each model
* **AND** the quota exhaustion detection should work for both models
* **AND** the provider status should distinguish between "Primary Model Throttled" and "Fallback Model Throttled"
* **AND** the system should track usage statistics separately for each model

## Priority: High
## Effort Estimate: Medium (requires model parameter integration, state management, and fallback logic)
## Dependencies: 
- Existing Gemini CLI integration (Story 2.1)
- Rate limiting system (Story 1.2)
- Daily quota handling (Story 2.2)

## Technical Implementation Notes:
- CLI command format: `gemini-cli --model <model-name> -p "prompt"`
- Primary model: `gemini-2.5-pro` (higher capability, lower quota)
- Fallback model: `gemini-2.5-flash-lite` (lower capability, higher quota)
- Model state tracking: In-memory flags with timestamps for each model
- Rate limit detection: Parse CLI error output for model-specific rate limiting
- Reset timing: Follow same UTC midnight reset logic as Story 2.2
- Environment variables: `GEMINI_PRIMARY_MODEL` and `GEMINI_FALLBACK_MODEL`

## Success Metrics:
- Seamless fallback from primary to fallback model when rate limited
- Automatic restoration of primary model usage after rate limit reset
- Zero service downtime when primary model is rate limited but fallback is available
- Clear logging and monitoring of model usage and fallback events
- Maintained performance and functionality with fallback model
- Independent rate limit tracking for both models
