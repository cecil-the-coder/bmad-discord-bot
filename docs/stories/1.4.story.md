# Story 1.4: Implement Conversational Context in Threads

## Status: Complete

## Story

- As a user
- I want to ask follow-up questions within a thread and have the bot understand the context of our conversation
- so that I can have a more natural and helpful interaction

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

* 1.4.1: When the bot is @-mentioned within a thread it created, it must fetch the message history of that thread.
* 1.4.2: The backend service must have a function to summarize the conversation history.
* 1.4.3: The prompt sent to the Gemini CLI must include both the summarized history and the user's new question.
* 1.4.4: The bot's new answer is posted as a reply within the same thread.
* 1.4.5: When the original user sends a message in a thread that was created by the bot in response to their question, the bot must automatically process and respond to the message without requiring an @mention, BUT only if the thread contains only the original user and the bot. Once other users participate in the thread, the bot must require @mentions from all users including the original user.

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights

From Story 1.3 implementation:
- AIService interface extension pattern is well-established and should be followed
- Thread detection logic using [`isMessageInThread()`](internal/bot/handler.go:91) is already implemented and working
- AI-powered summarization with fallback mechanisms is proven effective
- Comprehensive error handling patterns are established for Discord API operations
- Testing infrastructure for both unit and integration tests is robust

### Architecture Context

**Tech Stack Requirements**: [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- Language: Golang 1.24.x for backend service development
- Discord Library: discordgo v0.28.x for Discord Gateway API interaction and message history
- Testing: Go Test 1.24.x for unit & integration testing
- Logging: slog 1.24.x for structured logging

**Project Structure**: [Source: architecture/source-tree.md]
- AI service interface: [`internal/service/ai_interface.go`](internal/service/ai_interface.go:1) (extend existing)
- Gemini CLI implementation: [`internal/service/gemini_cli.go`](internal/service/gemini_cli.go:1) (extend existing)
- Core bot logic: [`internal/bot/handler.go`](internal/bot/handler.go:1) (extend existing)
- Main entry point: [`cmd/bot/main.go`](cmd/bot/main.go:1) (extend existing)

**Coding Standards**: [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]
- **CRITICAL**: All business logic for AI interaction **MUST** use the `AIService` interface
- No direct calls to `gemini-cli` outside of `GeminiCLIService` implementation
- All code must be formatted with `gofmt`
- Secrets must only be read from environment variables at startup

**External API Integration**: [Source: architecture/external-apis.md]
- **Discord Gateway API**: Used for thread message history retrieval and response posting
- **Google Gemini CLI**: Used for conversation summarization and contextual AI responses

**Data Models**: [Source: architecture/data-models.md]
- No persistent database required for MVP
- In-memory conversation context processing using Go structs
- RateLimitState struct available for API usage tracking [Source: architecture/data-models.md]

### Discord API Considerations

**Message History Requirements**:
- Use `ChannelMessages()` with thread ID to fetch conversation history
- Discord API limits: 100 messages per request, requires pagination for longer conversations
- Message ordering: Discord returns messages in reverse chronological order by default
- Thread permissions: Bot needs `READ_MESSAGE_HISTORY` permission in the channel

**Context Management**:
- Conversation context should be limited to reasonable token limits for Gemini CLI
- Filter out bot's own messages to prevent circular context
- Consider implementing context window sliding for very long conversations
- Preserve message authorship and timestamps for effective summarization

### Testing

Dev Note: Story Requires the following tests:

- [ ] Go Test Unit Tests: (nextToFile: true), coverage requirement: 80%
- [ ] Go Test Integration Test (Test Location): location: next to handler for Discord thread conversation validation

Manual Test Steps:
- Set BOT_TOKEN and GEMINI_CLI_PATH environment variables
- Run `go run cmd/bot/main.go`
- Send initial message in Discord server main channel: `@BotName What is the capital of France?`
- Verify bot creates thread with AI response (Story 1.3 functionality)
- Send follow-up in the created thread: `@BotName What is the population of that city?`
- Verify bot understands context and provides relevant answer about Paris population
- **NEW AC 1.4.5 Test**: Send follow-up in same thread WITHOUT @mention: `What is the population of that city?`
- Verify bot automatically responds with contextual answer without requiring @mention
- Test multiple follow-ups to verify conversation continuity without @mentions
- **Multi-User Test**: Have another user join the thread and send a message
- Verify that once multiple users are in the thread, the bot requires @mentions from ALL users including the original user
- Test that conversation context includes messages from all participants when multiple users are present
- Test edge cases: very long conversations, context summarization fallbacks, mixed @mention and non-@mention messages
