# Story 2.15: Improve Discord Message Formatting and User Experience

## Status: Done

üö® **CRITICAL BUG IDENTIFIED**: Root cause analysis reveals the line break issue is in `cleanCitations()` function in AI service layer, NOT Discord formatting. This story updated with exact fix location and debugging evidence.

## Story

**As a** Discord user interacting with the BMAD knowledge bot  
**I want** messages from the bot to be properly formatted with correct line breaks, without unnecessary part indicators, and with typing indicators while processing  
**so that** the bot's responses are easy to read, professional-looking, and provide clear feedback about processing status

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

* 2.15.1: Discord messages display proper line breaks and paragraph formatting without text being rendered as continuous blocks
* 2.15.2: Message chunking only displays part indicators ("[Part X/Y]") when messages actually exceed Discord's 2000 character limit and require splitting
* 2.15.3: The bot displays a typing indicator in the channel while processing AI queries to provide user feedback
* 2.15.4: Line break formatting works consistently across all message types (thread responses, DMs, Forum posts, main channel responses)
* 2.15.5: Improved formatting maintains compatibility with existing Discord markdown features (bold, italic, code blocks)
* 2.15.6: Typing indicators are cleared properly when responses are sent or errors occur
* 2.15.7: Performance improvements ensure message formatting doesn't introduce significant latency
* 2.15.8: All formatting improvements work correctly with the existing AIService interface and response parsing
* 2.15.9: Message state persistence errors ("context canceled") are handled gracefully without disrupting user experience or message processing
* 2.15.10: Users can send "/clear" in DMs to reset conversation history and start fresh, with helpful reminder notes included in responses

### ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS - CRITICAL DEBUGGING FINDINGS

**The Real Issue Discovered**: [Source: Kubernetes logs analysis + code debugging]

The line break issue is **NOT** in Discord formatting - it's in the AI service layer!

**Bug Location**: `internal/service/ollama_ai.go:1285` in `cleanCitations()` function
```go
// BROKEN CODE that destroys all newlines:
cleaned = regexp.MustCompile(`\s+`).ReplaceAllString(cleaned, " ")
// This regex replaces ALL whitespace (including \n) with single spaces!
```

**Evidence from Production Logs**:
```
Ollama API response received: response_length=1752 newline_count=16  ‚úÖ Good
formatForDiscord input analysis: original_length=1744 original_newlines=0  ‚ùå Already broken!
```

**Processing Pipeline Bug**:
1. AI generates response: 1752 chars, 16 newlines ‚úÖ
2. `executeQuery()` unescapes: 1744 chars, 16 newlines ‚úÖ  
3. `cleanCitations()` destroys: 1744 chars, **0 newlines** ‚ùå
4. `formatForDiscord()` can't fix: 1744 chars, 0 newlines ‚ùå

### Current Discord Message Handling Architecture

**Message Formatting Infrastructure**: [Source: internal/bot/handler.go:1200-1240]  
- `formatForDiscord(response string) string` - Discord formatting (receives already-broken input)
- `sendResponseInChunks(s *discordgo.Session, channelID string, response string)` - Message chunking logic
- `splitResponseIntoChunks(response string, maxLength int) []string` - Response splitting algorithm

**AI Service Processing Pipeline**: [Source: internal/service/ollama_ai.go analysis]
- `QueryWithContext()` ‚Üí calls `executeQuery()` ‚Üí calls `cleanCitations()` ‚Üí **DESTROYS NEWLINES**
- `executeQuery()` correctly preserves newlines from AI response 
- `cleanCitations()` incorrectly strips ALL whitespace including newlines
```

**Discord API Integration**: [Source: discordgo v0.28.1 verified documentation]
- `s.ChannelTypingStart(channelID)` - Trigger typing indicator (**VERIFIED**)
- `s.ChannelMessageSend(channelID, content)` - Send formatted messages
- Discord character limit: 2000 characters per message
- Discord markdown support: **bold**, *italic*, `code`, ```code blocks```

### Message Processing Flow Integration

**All Response Contexts**: [Source: internal/bot/handler.go:503-1960]
- Thread responses: `processAIQuery` ‚Üí `sendResponseInChunks`
- Main channel responses: `processMainChannelQuery` ‚Üí `sendResponseInChunks`
- DM responses: `processDMQuery` ‚Üí `sendResponseInChunks`
- Forum post responses: `processForumPost` ‚Üí `sendResponseInChunks`
- Reply mention responses: Various handlers ‚Üí `sendResponseInChunks`

**AIService Interface Compatibility**: [Source: internal/service/ai_interface.go]
- All response handling works through `AIService` interface
- Response parsing and formatting must maintain existing interface contracts
- Summary extraction and response processing remain unchanged

### File Structure and Implementation Locations

**Files to Modify**: [Source: Root cause analysis + docs/architecture/source-tree.md]
```
internal/service/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ollama_ai.go                    # CRITICAL FIX - cleanCitations() function destroys newlines
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ollama_ai_test.go              # MODIFY - Add tests for citation cleaning with newline preservation

internal/bot/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ handler.go                      # MODIFY - Add typing indicators, improve chunking logic
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ handler_test.go                 # MODIFY - Add formatting and typing indicator tests
```

**Functions Requiring Updates**: [Source: Root cause analysis + internal/bot/handler.go analysis]

**CRITICAL FIXES**:
- `cleanCitations(text string) string` in `internal/service/ollama_ai.go:1285` - **MUST FIX NEWLINE DESTRUCTION**
- Replace `\s+` regex with targeted cleanup that preserves newlines

**Secondary Improvements**:
- `sendResponseInChunks(s *discordgo.Session, channelID string, response string)` - Optimize chunking logic
- `splitResponseIntoChunks(response string, maxLength int) []string` - Improve boundary detection  
- Add new function: `triggerTypingIndicator(s *discordgo.Session, channelID string)` - Typing indicator management

### Discord Formatting Requirements

**Line Break Handling**: [Source: Discord API documentation analysis]
- Single `\n` creates line breaks within paragraphs
- Double `\n\n` creates paragraph separation
- Preserve existing markdown without double-processing
- Maintain code block integrity with ``` delimiters

**Character Limit Optimization**: [Source: Discord API limits]
- Actual limit: 2000 characters
- Current implementation reserves 20 characters for headers unnecessarily
- Optimize to maximize content per message while avoiding splits

**Typing Indicator Best Practices**: [Source: Discord API documentation]
- Typing indicators auto-expire after 10 seconds
- Should be triggered before AI processing starts
- Must be cleared on completion (automatic when message sent)
- Works in all channel types (DMs, threads, Forum posts, main channels)

### Testing

**Testing Standards**: [Source: docs/architecture/test-strategy.md]

Dev Note: Story Requires the following tests:

- [ ] Go Test Unit Tests: (nextToFile: true), coverage requirement: 80%
- [ ] Go Test Integration Test (Test Location): location: next to handler
- [ ] Manual Testing: Verify formatting improvements across all Discord contexts

**Test Scenarios Required**:
- Line break formatting with various AI response types
- Message chunking behavior at character limit boundaries
- Typing indicator functionality in threads, DMs, Forum posts, and main channels
- Markdown preservation (bold, italic, code blocks) through formatting
- Performance testing with large responses (>2000 characters)
- Edge cases: empty responses, responses with only whitespace, responses with complex markdown

**Manual Test Steps**:
- Send queries that generate responses with bullet points and paragraphs
- Test responses near 2000 character limit to verify chunking behavior
- Observe typing indicators during AI processing across different channel types
- Verify line breaks display correctly in Discord client across desktop and mobile
- Test markdown formatting preservation (**bold**, *italic*, `code blocks`)
