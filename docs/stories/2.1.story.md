# Story 2.1: Transform Bot to BMAD Knowledge Expert

## Status: Complete

## Story

- As a user
- I want the bot to answer questions exclusively using the BMAD-METHOD knowledge base
- so that I get accurate, contextual answers about the BMAD framework without hallucinations or off-topic responses

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

* 2.1.1: The bot's Gemini CLI integration is updated to include the BMAD prompt knowledge base (`docs/bmadprompt.md`) as the primary context for all queries.
* 2.1.2: The bot's system prompt instructs it to answer ONLY based on the BMAD knowledge base, refusing to answer questions outside this scope.
* 2.1.3: When asked about topics not covered in the BMAD knowledge base, the bot politely indicates that the information is not available in its knowledge base.
* 2.1.4: The bot maintains citation capability, referencing specific sections of the BMAD documentation when providing answers.
* 2.1.5: The bot's responses are focused, contextual, and directly relevant to the BMAD-METHOD framework.
* 2.1.6: The conversational context in threads (from Story 1.4) continues to work but is constrained to BMAD-related discussions.

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [x] Task 1: Update Gemini CLI Integration for BMAD Knowledge Base (AC: 2.1.1, 2.1.2)
  - [x] Modify `GeminiCLIService` in `internal/service/gemini_cli.go` to include BMAD prompt as system context
  - [x] Update the `ExecuteQuery` method to prepend the BMAD knowledge base content to every query
  - [x] Implement a system prompt that restricts responses to BMAD knowledge only
  - [x] Add configuration for the BMAD prompt file path (default: `docs/bmadprompt.md`)
  - [x] Ensure the knowledge base is loaded once at startup for efficiency
  - [x] Add error handling for missing or invalid BMAD prompt file

- [x] Task 2: Implement Knowledge Base Constraint Logic (AC: 2.1.3, 2.1.5)
  - [x] Create a prompt template that instructs the AI to only answer from the provided knowledge base
  - [x] Add explicit instructions to refuse off-topic questions politely
  - [x] Implement response validation to ensure answers stay within BMAD scope
  - [x] Add logging for queries that fall outside the knowledge base scope
  - [x] Test edge cases where users try to bypass the constraints

- [x] Task 3: Add Citation Support (AC: 2.1.4)
  - [x] Preserve citation markers from the BMAD prompt in responses
  - [x] Format citations appropriately for Discord messages
  - [x] Ensure citations are maintained through the conversation history
  - [x] Add configuration option to enable/disable citation display
  - [x] Test citation accuracy across different types of BMAD queries

- [x] Task 4: Update Thread Context Management (AC: 2.1.6)
  - [x] Modify conversation history summarization to maintain BMAD context
  - [x] Ensure follow-up questions in threads remain constrained to BMAD knowledge
  - [x] Update thread title generation to reflect BMAD-specific queries
  - [x] Test multi-turn conversations stay within knowledge base bounds
  - [x] Add appropriate context pruning to fit within token limits

- [x] Task 5: Configuration and Documentation Updates
  - [x] Add environment variable `BMAD_PROMPT_PATH` for knowledge base location
  - [x] Update `README.md` with new BMAD-specific bot functionality
  - [x] Document the knowledge base constraint behavior
  - [x] Add deployment notes about including the BMAD prompt file
  - [x] Update Docker configuration to include BMAD prompt file

- [x] Task 6: Testing Implementation
  - [x] Create unit tests for BMAD knowledge base loading and integration
  - [x] Test constraint logic with various query types (in-scope vs out-of-scope)
  - [x] Create integration tests for end-to-end BMAD query processing
  - [x] Test citation preservation and formatting
  - [x] Test thread conversations maintain BMAD context
  - [x] Add performance tests for knowledge base loading and query processing

## Dev Notes

### Implementation Changes

- **Knowledge Base Location**: Instead of mounting the entire `docs/` folder via Docker volumes, the BMAD knowledge base is now copied to `internal/knowledge/bmad.md` and included directly in the Docker image. This simplifies deployment and ensures the knowledge base is always available.
- **Default Path Updated**: The default `BMAD_PROMPT_PATH` is now `internal/knowledge/bmad.md` instead of `docs/bmadprompt.md`
- **Docker Configuration**: Removed the docs volume mount from `docker-compose.yml` and updated the Dockerfile to copy only the knowledge base files
