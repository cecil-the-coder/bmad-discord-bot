# Story 2.6: Implement Periodic BMAD Knowledge Base Refresh

## Status: Done

## Story

- As a system administrator
- I want the bot to periodically check and refresh the internal BMAD knowledge base from the remote source
- so that the bot always provides answers based on the latest BMAD-METHOD documentation without requiring manual updates or redeployment

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

* 2.6.1: The system includes a configurable HTTP client service that can fetch the remote BMAD knowledge base from `https://github.com/bmadcode/BMAD-METHOD/raw/refs/heads/main/bmad-core/data/bmad-kb.md`
* 2.6.2: A background service checks for updates to the remote knowledge base on a configurable interval (default: every 6 hours)
* 2.6.3: The system compares the remote content with the local `internal/knowledge/bmad.md` file to detect changes (using content hash or last-modified headers)
* 2.6.4: When changes are detected, the system downloads the remote content and merges it with the local file, preserving the first line (system prompt) of the local `internal/knowledge/bmad.md` file
* 2.6.5: The refresh process includes proper error handling for network failures, invalid responses, and file system errors
* 2.6.6: The refresh interval, remote URL, and feature enable/disable are configurable via environment variables
* 2.6.7: The system logs refresh attempts, successes, failures, and change detections with appropriate severity levels
* 2.6.8: The bot continues to function normally if the refresh service fails, using the existing local knowledge base

  - [x] Test graceful degradation when refresh service is disabled or failing

## Dev Notes

### Requirements Source Verification
- **Parent Epic**: Epic 2 (BMAD Knowledge Bot Specialization) in docs/prd/epic-2.md
- **All acceptance criteria traced** to Epic 2, Story 2.6 requirements
- **Story ready for development** post-documentation consolidation

### Previous Story Insights
From Story 2.5: The bot now uses SQLite for state persistence. The knowledge refresh should be independent of this system and continue to work even if the database is unavailable.

### Technical Implementation Details
- **New Service Location**: Create `internal/service/knowledge_updater.go` following the AIService interface pattern [Source: architecture/source-tree.md]
- **HTTP Client**: Use Go's standard `net/http` client with appropriate timeouts and retry logic
- **File Operations**: Implement atomic file update that preserves local system prompt while replacing knowledge base content using temporary files and rename operations
- **Background Service**: Use `time.Ticker` for periodic execution, integrated into main application lifecycle
- **Configuration**: Follow existing environment variable pattern from `.env.example` [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]

### Remote Source Details
**Remote URL**: `https://github.com/bmadcode/BMAD-METHOD/raw/refs/heads/main/bmad-core/data/bmad-kb.md`
**Local Target**: `internal/knowledge/bmad.md`
**Content Merging**: Preserve first line (system prompt) from local file, replace remaining content with remote knowledge base
**Refresh Strategy**: Content-based comparison to avoid unnecessary updates
**Error Handling**: Graceful degradation - continue using existing local file if refresh fails

### Data Models
**KnowledgeUpdater Interface:**
```go
type KnowledgeUpdater interface {
    Start(ctx context.Context) error
    Stop() error
    RefreshNow() error
    GetLastRefresh() time.Time
    GetRefreshStatus() RefreshStatus
}

type RefreshStatus struct {
    LastAttempt   time.Time
    LastSuccess   time.Time
    LastError     error
    UpdatesFound  int
    TotalAttempts int
}
```

### Architecture Integration
- **Interface Pattern**: Follow the AIService model for clean abstraction [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]
- **Structured Logging**: Use slog for consistent logging format [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- **Configuration**: Environment variables only, no hardcoded values [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]
- **Error Handling**: Robust error handling with proper logging and graceful degradation

### Performance Considerations
- Use ETag/Last-Modified headers to minimize unnecessary downloads
- Implement exponential backoff for retry logic
- Atomic file operations with content merging to preserve local system prompt while updating knowledge base
- Configurable intervals to balance freshness with resource usage
- Background service should not block main bot functionality

### Testing

Dev Note: Story Requires the following tests:

- [ ] Go Test Unit Tests: (nextToFile: true), coverage requirement: 80%
- [ ] Go Test Integration Test (Test Location): location: `internal/service/knowledge_updater_test.go`
- [ ] Manual E2E Test: location: Manual verification of knowledge base refresh functionality

Manual Test Steps:
- Start bot with refresh service enabled and short interval (e.g., 1 minute)
- Verify initial knowledge base is loaded from local file with system prompt preserved
- Monitor logs for refresh attempts and status
- Temporarily modify remote source and verify bot detects and downloads changes while preserving local system prompt
- Test with invalid remote URL and verify graceful error handling
- Test with network disconnection and verify bot continues functioning with local knowledge base
- Verify configuration changes take effect after bot restart
