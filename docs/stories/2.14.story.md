# Story 2.14: Add Discord Forum Channel Support for BMAD Knowledge Bot

## Status: Done

## Story

**As a** Discord user who is a member of a server where the BMAD knowledge bot is active  
**I want** the bot to monitor Forum channels (specifically #help-requests) and automatically respond to new posts as though it had been mentioned  
**so that** I can get BMAD-related answers in a structured, organized Forum environment without needing to explicitly mention the bot

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

* 2.14.1: The bot detects and processes new posts created in designated Forum channels without requiring explicit bot mentions
* 2.14.2: The bot identifies Forum channels using discordgo.ChannelTypeGuildForum and distinguishes Forum posts from regular messages
* 2.14.3: Forum posts are processed with the same BMAD knowledge base constraints and response quality as regular channel interactions
* 2.14.4: The bot responds directly within the Forum post thread, maintaining the organized structure of Forum discussions
* 2.14.5: Forum post message state is persisted in the database using the existing message_states table structure with appropriate channel_id and thread_id tracking
* 2.14.6: The bot maintains conversation context within Forum post threads, enabling multi-turn conversations about BMAD topics
* 2.14.7: Forum processing integrates with existing rate limiting, error handling, and AI service infrastructure
* 2.14.8: Forum functionality is configurable to specify which Forum channels should be monitored (default: #help-requests)

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights

From Story 2.13: The application supports DM processing with guild membership verification, message state persistence, and conversation context tracking. Similar patterns can be applied to Forum post processing. [Source: docs/stories/2.13.story.md]

From Story 2.12: The application is cloud-native stateless with MySQL as the primary database, eliminating local filesystem dependencies. Forum message states will use the same MySQL persistence. [Source: docs/stories/2.12.story.md]

From Story 2.11: The bot operates exclusively with Ollama through the AIService interface. Forum processing will use the same AIService implementation. [Source: docs/stories/2.11.story.md]

### Discord Forum Channel Architecture

**Channel Type Detection**: [Source: discordgo v0.28.1 library verified documentation]
- Discord Forums use `discordgo.ChannelTypeGuildForum` (value: 15) - **VERIFIED**
- Forum posts are actually threads within the Forum channel
- Each Forum post has a thread ID and the parent Forum channel ID

**Forum vs Regular Channels**: [Source: discordgo v0.28.1 verified implementation]
```go
// Forum channel detection
if channel.Type == discordgo.ChannelTypeGuildForum {
    // This is a Forum channel
}

// Forum post detection (thread within Forum channel)
parentChannel, err := s.Channel(channel.ParentID)
if err == nil && parentChannel.Type == discordgo.ChannelTypeGuildForum {
    // This message is in a Forum post thread
}
```

**Forum-Specific Functions Available**: [Source: discordgo v0.28.1 verified implementation]
- `s.ForumThreadStart(channelID, name string, archiveDuration int, content string)` - **VERIFIED** - Create Forum posts programmatically
- `s.ForumThreadStartComplex(channelID string, threadData *ThreadStart, messageData *MessageSend)` - **VERIFIED** - Create Forum posts with advanced configuration
- `s.ForumThreadStartEmbed()` and `s.ForumThreadStartEmbeds()` - **VERIFIED** - Create Forum posts with embed content
- Forum posts support tags, titles, and organization features

### Current Bot Architecture Integration

**Message Processing Infrastructure**: [Source: internal/bot/handler.go]
- HandleMessageCreate already processes different channel types (DMs, threads, regular channels)
- Current logic includes DM detection (`isDMChannel`) and thread detection (`isMessageInThread`)
- Bot mentions are detected using `m.Mentions` and `s.State.User.ID` comparison
- Message state recording uses `recordMessageState(m, isInThread)` for persistence

**Existing Channel Type Detection**: [Source: internal/bot/handler.go:252-254]
```go
// Current thread detection logic
return channel.Type == discordgo.ChannelTypeGuildPublicThread ||
    channel.Type == discordgo.ChannelTypeGuildPrivateThread ||
    channel.Type == discordgo.ChannelTypeGuildNewsThread
```

**Message State Persistence Structure**: [Source: docs/architecture/database-schema.md, docs/architecture/data-models.md]
- `message_states` table uses (channel_id, thread_id) combination as unique key
- For Forum posts: channel_id = Forum channel ID, thread_id = Forum post thread ID
- Existing schema supports Forum post tracking without modifications
- Database operations handle thread_id appropriately for thread-based conversations

### Forum-Specific Implementation Requirements

**New Helper Functions Needed**: [Source: project structure analysis]
- `isForumChannel(s *discordgo.Session, channelID string) bool`
- `isForumPost(s *discordgo.Session, channel *discordgo.Channel) bool`
- `processForumPost(s *discordgo.Session, m *discordgo.MessageCreate)`
- `shouldMonitorForumChannel(channelID string) bool` - configuration-based filtering

**Configuration Requirements**: [Source: Story 2.10 database configuration pattern]
- Environment variable: `MONITORED_FORUM_CHANNELS` (comma-separated channel IDs)
- Database configuration entry for dynamic Forum channel management
- Default monitoring for channels named containing "help" or "requests"

**Integration with Existing Infrastructure**: [Source: multiple architecture files]
- Forum processing uses same AIService interface (critical coding standard)
- Forum posts follow existing conversation context patterns from thread handling
- Rate limiting applies equally to Forum posts as other message types
- Error handling patterns consistent with existing DM and thread processing

### Database Schema Compatibility

**Current Schema Adequacy**: [Source: docs/architecture/database-schema.md, Story 2.12 MySQL migration]
```sql
-- Existing MySQL schema supports Forum posts without modification
CREATE TABLE message_states (
    id BIGINT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    channel_id VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,   -- Forum channel ID for Forum posts
    thread_id VARCHAR(255) NULL,        -- Forum post thread ID
    last_message_id VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    last_seen_timestamp BIGINT NOT NULL,
    created_at BIGINT NOT NULL,
    updated_at BIGINT NOT NULL,
    UNIQUE KEY unique_channel_thread (channel_id, thread_id)
);
```

**Data Model Compatibility**: [Source: docs/architecture/data-models.md, Story 2.12 MySQL migration]
- Existing MessageState struct supports Forum posts with thread_id for Forum post threads
- Forum posts will use Forum channel ID as channel_id and post thread ID as thread_id
- No MySQL schema modifications required for Forum support
- Database operations use MySQL-compatible data types (VARCHAR, BIGINT, AUTO_INCREMENT)

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-08-02

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Senior Developer QA)

### Code Quality Assessment

**EXCELLENT** - This implementation demonstrates exemplary senior-level development practices. The developer has successfully implemented a comprehensive Discord Forum channel support feature with clean architecture integration, proper error handling, and thorough testing coverage.

Key strengths observed:
- Perfect integration with existing AIService interface (maintains clean separation of concerns)
- Comprehensive error handling with graceful degradation
